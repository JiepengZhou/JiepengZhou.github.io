# üëã Welcome! 
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now an undergraduate student at [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm), Guangdong, China. At the same time, I have passed the interview with the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/)'s Red Bird Mphil committee and will pursue an Mphil degree at HKUST(GZ) starting in September 2025. 

Fortunately, I was selected into the excellent student training program during my undergraduate studies, which only 1% of the whole university were selected. Then, I received a series of scientific research training under the guidance of [Dr.Qingliang Chen](https://faculty.jnu.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/cql2/list.htm), [Dr.Ke Wang](https://faculty.jnu.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/wk/list.htm) and [Dr.Lin Cui](https://faculty.jnu.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/cl6/list.htm).

From *2022* to *2024*, I participated in the Guangdong Provincial Key Field R&D Program-"Research and Application of Key Technologies for Digital Publishing Platform Based on Artificial Intelligence(Project No.:2022B0101010005)."

During my undergraduate studies, I also participated as the person in charge in the National College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (Finally received *Excellent results*), the China College Students' "Internet +" Competition, the Challenge Cup and other projects.

My research interest includes *natural language processing* and *Large Language Models*. **I look forward to exploring more possibilities of artificial intelligence in our daily life and making my own achievements.**

You can find my CV here: [Jiepeng Zhou's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

[A deep authentication technology for distinguishing Generated Text from Human Text based on the BHL model]()

**Zhou Jiepeng**, Zhuoxing Li, Zhuoye Yang, Bo Yang

[**Project**]() <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Train a large model capable of distinguishing generated text from human text by Bert and LSTM combined with the Attention mechanism.
- The BHL model was compared with models such as TextCNN, TextRCNN, and BiLSTM, and an ablation experiment was performed with Bert-Han to verify the model performance.
- The model achieved an accuracy of over 97% on the discrimination task.
